# GAMES
You can play some games with coding
$Game 1: Path Finder
  +  In a grid-based game, a player starts at the top-left corner of an m × n grid (m columns and n rows) and wants to reach the bottom-right corner. The player can only move right or down. Write a function pathfinder in a file called pathfinder.py that, given the dimensions of the grid, returns all possible paths the player can take to reach the destination. Represent each path as a string of ’R’ (right) and ’D’ (down) moves.
For instance:
pathfinder(1, 1) -> []
pathfinder(2, 2) -> [’RD’, ’DR’]
pathfinder(1, 9) -> [’DDDDDDDD’]
pathfinder(3, 3) -> [’RRDD’, ’RDRD’, ’RDDR’, ’DRRD’, ’DRDR’, ’DDRR’]
$Game 2: Draw Flower
  +  You can code to draw a flower here, the length and how dense your flower based on your decision.
$Game 3: Draw Star
  +  You can code to draw a star here, the length and number of angles of your star based on your decision.
$Game 4: Encryption
  +  You can hide your real messages by turning them into secret symbols like this
